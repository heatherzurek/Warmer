        <p>Our Earth's climate is now changing faster than at any point in the history of modern civilization. This is primarily as a result of human activities. Global cliate change has already resulted in a wide range of impacts across every region of the country.</p>
        <p>Thousands of studies conducted by researchers around the world have documented increases in temperature at Earthâ€™s surface, as well as in the atmosphere and oceans. Many other aspects of global climate are changing as well. Human activities, especially emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases from fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, and land-use change, are the primary driver of the climate changes observed in the industrial era.</p>
